# Movie Correlation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning a movie dataset and analyzing the correlations between different factors such as production company, gross revenue, budget, and more. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about movies, including:
- Movie title
- Release year
- Budget
- Gross revenue
- Production company
- Other relevant features

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Explore the relationships between budget, revenue, and other movie-related factors.
- Use correlation analysis to identify which variables have the strongest impact on movie revenue.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for analysis and documentation)

## Key Findings
- Budget and gross revenue have a strong positive correlation.
- Production companies play a significant role in movie earnings.
- Other insights were derived through data visualization and correlation heatmaps.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository : `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Correlation-Project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis: `jupyter notebook Movie Correlation Project.ipynb`

## Results & Visualization
The project includes visualizations such as:

- Scatter plots showing the relationship between budget and revenue.
- Heatmaps displaying the correlation matrix.
- Additional charts to illustrate trends in the dataset.
